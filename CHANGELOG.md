### Added

- Added advanced GitHub OSS CI and release hardening for macOS and Ubuntu bootstrap module.
- Added public adapter CI policy-aligned workflow set: `validate`, `actionlint`,
  `codeql`, `dependency-check`, `gitleaks/secret-scan`, `dependency-review`,
  `pytest`, `cross-platform`, `scorecard`, and `release`.
- Added deterministic release pipeline with version checks, SPDX SBOM generation,
  hash manifest, and attestations.
- Added CI smoke tests and baseline `CHANGELOG.md` with release block.

### Fixed

- Fixed Ubuntu installer parity to install `marksman` in the LSP layer, matching
  `verify.sh` contract and macOS behavior.
- Corrected dependency-check and release workflow behavior for pinned runtime validation and SBOM manifest generation.
- Normalized CI workflow hardening artifacts and docs to include full OSS capability set used by module (`validate`, `pytest`, `actionlint`, `codeql`, `gitleaks/secret-scan`, `dependency-review`, `dependency-check`, `cross-platform`, `scorecard`, `release`).
- Synchronized README/docs/security text with actual branch-protection and public repository security controls.
