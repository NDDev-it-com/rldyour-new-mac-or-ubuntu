# rldyour New Mac or Ubuntu Bootstrap

## Purpose

This repository owns plan-first bootstrap and verification for the rldyour AI
CLI environment on Apple Silicon macOS desktops, Ubuntu 24.04/26.04 desktops,
and headless Ubuntu 24.04/26.04 servers.

It is an adapter, not an upstream AI runtime. Keep installation logic,
verification, contract metadata, tests, and documentation synchronized.

## Sources Of Truth

- Public compositor: `scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- Shared helpers and managed browser layer: `scripts/lib/common.sh`
- macOS installer/verifier: `scripts/macos/install.sh`, `scripts/macos/verify.sh`
- Ubuntu installer/verifier: `scripts/ubuntu/install.sh`, `scripts/ubuntu/verify.sh`
- Ubuntu server module/verifier: `scripts/ubuntu/server.sh`, `scripts/ubuntu/verify-server.sh`
- Authentication handoff: `scripts/auth-handoff.sh`
- Machine-readable contract: `config/rldyour-contract.json`
- Profile/browser decision: `docs/adr/0004-profile-composition-and-cloakbrowser-boundary.md`
- Operator guide: `README.md`, `docs/install.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- Product version: `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`

When prose and implementation disagree, verify the scripts and contract, then
update the affected documentation in the same change. Do not invent a second
policy source.

## Contract `0.3.7`

Ubuntu profile selection is always explicit. Never infer server/rootful Docker
from `uname=Linux`; require `--profile desktop|server`.

Supported compositions:

- Apple Silicon macOS: `desktop`, GUI enabled or disabled, Docker `none`,
  `source-lsp-only`.
- Ubuntu 24.04/26.04 `amd64` or `arm64` desktop: GUI enabled or disabled,
  Docker `none`, `source-lsp-only`.
- Ubuntu 24.04/26.04 `amd64` or `arm64` server: headless, Docker
  `none|rootful|rootless`, default `rootful`, `server-build-runtime`.

macOS never accepts the server profile. Desktop profiles never install Docker
or configure local project build/runtime execution. `--no-gui` removes only
the GUI overlay; it does not change the desktop execution policy. Server is
Ubuntu-only and always headless.

## Managed Versions

These values must match both platform installers, the contract, tests, and
operator documentation:

- Claude Code: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.206`
- Codex: `@openai/codex@0.144.1`
- OpenCode: `opencode-ai@1.17.18`
- MiMoCode: `@mimo-ai/cli@0.1.5`
- Antigravity (`agy`): exact `1.1.1`, self-update disabled
- RTK: exact `0.43.0`, hash-pinned native artifact
- CloakBrowser: `0.4.10`
- Chrome DevTools MCP: `1.5.0`
- Playwright CLI: `0.1.17`
- Webwright: retired fail-closed; publish only the exact disabled wrapper
- Ubuntu Node.js/uv/Bun: `24.18.0` / `0.11.28` / `1.3.14`, immutable assets
  with tracked architecture hashes

Use current, source-backed facts before changing a dependency. Preserve exact
pins and integrity checks unless the change intentionally updates the contract.
Never reintroduce mutable, unauthenticated remote installer execution or
unfrozen dependency resolution. Registry-backed AI CLIs use
`templates/ai-cli/bun.lock` with lifecycle scripts disabled. The Node browser
providers use `templates/browser/provider/bun.lock`; CloakBrowser uses its
tracked `uv.lock`.

## Non-Negotiable Browser Boundary

CloakBrowser is mandatory on every profile. A managed launchd or systemd user
service owns `http://127.0.0.1:9222`. Chrome DevTools MCP, Playwright CLI, and
the exact disabled Webwright tombstone are repository-managed. Only Chrome
DevTools MCP and Playwright CLI are active and may use the fixed endpoint;
Webwright must exit `78` without starting Python or a browser.

There is no supported `--skip-browser`, `RLDYOUR_SKIP_CLOAKBROWSER`, alternate
browser executable, alternate endpoint, auto-started stock browser, or stock
Chromium fallback. Playwright `run-code` and `--filename` are also forbidden.
Missing, unhealthy, or receipt-divergent browser state must fail closed. Never
bind the CDP listener beyond loopback. Use `scripts/verify-browser-runtime.sh`
as the exact installed-runtime authority.

Preserve unmanaged browser files and fail instead of adopting or replacing
them. Runtime browser profiles, traces, caches, tokens, and service state must
never be committed.

## GUI And Integrity Boundaries

- macOS GUI: Ghostty, cmux, ChatGPT, the separate Codex app, and Claude Desktop.
- Ubuntu GUI: Claude Desktop; ChatGPT, Codex, and cmux have no supported Linux
  builds.
- Ubuntu server: no GUI applications.

ZCode `3.3.3` remains manual by default because upstream publishes no checksum
or signature manifest. On Ubuntu, installation is allowed only when the owner
supplies a separately verified `RLDYOUR_ZCODE_SHA256`. Do not add a silent
download, fallback checksum, or integrity bypass.

Authentication is a post-install owner handoff. `scripts/auth-handoff.sh` may
show instructions and perform non-secret status probes, but bootstrap code must
not read, print, store, upload, or synthesize credentials.

## Ubuntu Server Safety

Plan mode is the default. Rootful Docker is the composed server default, but
the installer never grants Docker group membership. Rootless and `none` remain
explicit alternatives.

The full Ubuntu compositor runs as the non-root sudo-capable developer account
that owns its home and systemd-user browser service. Root-only automation may
use the sourceable server layer, not install AI state under `/root`.

UFW, key-only SSH, and Fail2ban are independent explicit opt-ins. Never infer
them from the server profile. Preserve these safeguards:

- require a non-root account with a readable supported public key before
  disabling password authentication;
- require `ssh-keygen` parsing and StrictModes-safe key path metadata;
- validate OpenSSH syntax and full `sshd -T -C` user/client/local connection
  contexts before reload, including a separate root context;
- preserve the active/enabled `ssh.service` versus `ssh.socket` provider and
  never restart a socket for authentication-only changes;
- restore the previous managed SSH drop-in after validation or reload failure;
- add the SSH allow rule before enabling UFW;
- validate the Fail2ban jail before restart;
- restore prior Fail2ban file/service state after activation failure;
- preserve existing synchronized NTP/PTP providers;
- warn operators to keep the current SSH session open until a second connection
  succeeds;
- do not pretend UFW alone contains Docker-published ports;
- do not add generic sysctl or resource-limit tuning without a separate,
  host-specific decision.
- never upgrade apt packages or an existing healthy Docker runtime implicitly;
  fail on partial/custom Docker state.

Full server validation requires a real supported Ubuntu VM with systemd.

## Implementation Rules

- Keep shell entry points strict, idempotent, plan-aware, and non-interactive
  unless an explicit owner handoff is the purpose.
- Never pipe a remote network stream directly into a shell. Download to a
  temporary file, verify available integrity metadata, then execute.
- Update managed files atomically. Preserve unmanaged or user-modified files
  and fail with a clear explanation.
- Keep shell policy in owned `~/.config/rldyour/` drop-ins. Modify owner shell
  files only through the delimited, backed-up source blocks and verify a fresh
  login shell after apply.
- Ubuntu Node.js, uv, and Bun must retain verified runtime receipts and exact
  managed links; an external same-version PATH binary is not provenance.
- APT key validation must reject bundles with more than one primary key.
- Keep desktop source/LSP manifests free of Docker and general project runtime
  dependencies.
- Keep server build/runtime and hardening behavior in the Ubuntu server layer.
- Prefer existing shared helpers and namespaced server functions over duplicate
  shell logic.
- Do not swallow errors, fake successful checks, or downgrade mandatory checks
  to best-effort behavior.
- Do not commit credentials, `.env` files, local browser state, caches, traces,
  diagnostics output, or runtime markers.

## Common Commands

Plan:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform macos
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform macos --no-gui
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform ubuntu --profile desktop
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform ubuntu --profile server
```

Apply:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform macos --apply
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform ubuntu --profile desktop --apply
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --platform ubuntu --profile server --apply
```

Supported skip flags are `--skip-system`, `--skip-ai`, `--skip-lsps`, and
`--skip-checks`. Do not document a browser skip.

Authentication handoff:

```bash
bash scripts/auth-handoff.sh show
bash scripts/auth-handoff.sh check
```

## Verification Gates

Run checks matching the touched scope and report exact commands:

```bash
bash scripts/ci/lint.sh
bash scripts/ci/validate.sh
python3 -m pytest
```

Use platform verification on real targets when platform behavior changes:

```bash
bash scripts/macos/verify.sh --strict
bash scripts/ubuntu/verify.sh --strict
bash scripts/ubuntu/verify-server.sh --docker-mode rootful
```

For documentation-only changes, at minimum run `git diff --check` and targeted
stale-fact scans. Do not claim macOS, Ubuntu GUI, SSH, firewall, systemd, or
Docker runtime evidence that was not actually produced.

## Git And Delivery

- Preserve unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree.
- Use atomic Conventional Commits when commits are requested.
- Keep implementation, tests/validators, docs/policy, and generated metadata
  independently reviewable when practical.
- Do not force-push `main` or rewrite pushed history without explicit approval.
- Releases support numeric tag pushes and a numeric `workflow_dispatch` input.
  Manual dispatch must use the exact `origin/main` commit, require its green
  `bootstrap-gate`, and verify an already existing exact non-rewritten tag.
  Root automation is the sole tag creator; the pinned reusable workflow owns
  immutable release publication.
- Move any superproject gitlink only after this repository's changes are pushed
  and verified.
